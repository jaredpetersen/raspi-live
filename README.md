### Global Flags
##### --width int
Video width. Defaults to 1920.

##### --height int
Video height. Defaults to 1080.

##### --fps int
Video framerate. Defaults to 30.

##### --horizontal-flip
Horizontally flip the video.

##### --vertical-flip
Vertically flip the video.

##### --port int
Static file server port. Finds an available port if one is not specified.

### Commands
#### HLS
[HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) is a video streaming format that works by splitting the video
into small consummable segments that are arranged in a continuously changing playlist of files. The client reads from
the playlist and downloads the video segments as needed. HLS requires a static file server to serve all of these files
and raspilive provides this out of the box automatically.

##### Flags
###### --directory string
Static file server directory. Defaults to the current directory.

Those concerned about the long-term health of their Raspberry Pi's SD card may opt to point raspilive to a RAMDisk so
that the files are only stored in memory. However, this also means that you will be unable to recover any of the 
footage if the power is cut.

###### --tls-cert string
Static file server TLS certificate.

###### --tls-key string
Static file server TLS key.

###### --segment-type string
Format of the video segments. Valid values include `mpegts` and `fmp4`. Defaults to `mpegts`.

###### --segment-time int
Target segment duration in seconds. Defaults to `2`.

###### --playlist-size int
Maximum number of playlist entries. Defaults to `10`.

###### --storage-size int
Maximum number of unreferenced segments to keep on disk before removal. Defaults to `1`.

#### DASH
[DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP), also known as MPEG-DASH, is a video
streaming format that works by splitting the video into small consummable segments that are arranged in a continuously
changing playlist of files. The client reads from the playlist and downloads the video segments as needed. DASH
requires a static file server to serve all of these files and raspilive provides this out of the box automatically.

##### Flags
###### --port int
Static file server port. Finds an available port if one is not specified.

###### --directory string
Static file server directory. Defaults to the current directory.

Those concerned about the long-term health of their Raspberry Pi's SD card may opt to point raspilive to a RAMDisk so
that the files are only stored in memory. However, this also means that you will be unable to recover any of the 
footage if the power is cut.

###### --tls-cert string
Static file server TLS certificate.

###### --tls-key string
Static file server TLS key.

###### --segment-time int
Target segment duration in seconds. Defaults to `2`.

###### --playlist-size int
Maximum number of playlist entries. Defaults to `10`.

###### --storage-size int
Maximum number of unreferenced segments to keep on disk before removal. Defaults to `1`.

## Installation
raspilive uses [raspivid](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspivid.md) to operate the
Raspberry Pi Camera Module. This is already available on the Raspbian operating system and can be enabled via 
[raspi-config](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md).

raspilive also uses [Ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), a prominent video conversion command line utility, to process the
streaming video that the Raspberry Pi Camera Module outputs. Version 4.0 or higher is required.
```zsh
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Download the latest version of raspilive from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jaredpetersen/raspi-live/releases).
All of the release binaries are compiled for ARM 6 and are compatible with Raspberry Pi.
